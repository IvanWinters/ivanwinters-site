      Today, I decided to embark on a little experiment with artificial
      intelligence, diving into the realm of video game graphics. I was
      particularly intrigued by the challenge of recreating the famous victory
      screen from the game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) â€” the "WINNER
      WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!".

      Using Chat GPT DALL-E I tried to generate a very similar image trying to
      resemble the screenshot I initially sent. Here is the initial result

    </a>
    <p>
      As you can see it is very obviously a reference to the game PUBG but a lot
      of the GUI/UI aspects are clearly in the wrong place. My expectations were
      that the graphics were going to be obviously AI generated but the GUI
      would mostly stay in the same area and resemble the original picture I
      sent.
      <br />
      <br />
      I tried addressing those issues that I just listed and I again prompted
      DALL-E to try with the corrections.

    </a>
    <p>
      None of the corrections I mentioned were shown on the image DALL-E
      generated. It was actually worse than the first one because the classic
      phrase "winner winner chicken dinner" was not included. Instead, it says
      "chicken giinner!". Now with this obvious failure, I went to ask Chat-GPT
      to write a blog about what it thought about how successful it was in
      generating images that were similar to the original.

    </a>
    <p>
      What I really found interesting was that it interpreted what I considered
      a failure to adhere to the prompt as it was taking a creative take on gaps
      left for interpretation. Hence why it was different in many aspects to the
      original screenshot I initially sent.
