    <h1>Torus/Donut in OpenGL without three.js</h1>

      Below is my final project for a computer graphics class. Originally wanted to do this idea with a pre-made blender model but I couldn't figure
      out how to export it. So I made a torus/donut from scratch using OpenGL and gl-matrix. I put a texture on my torus to make it more donut like.
      As you can see it distorts on the outer areas of the torus. I think this is because of the way I set up the texture coordinates. I used a
      texture of a donut and I think the distortion is because the texture is not set up to be repeated. I also added some lighting to make it look
      more realistic. I used a directional light and a point light. The point light is the one that is moving around the torus. I also added some
      ambient light to make it look more realistic. I used a white light for the directional light and a yellow light for the point light.

      Its not perfect but I think its a good start. If I ever decide to play around with web-graphics again I will be using three.js. -- until my next
      graphics project (probably never).
