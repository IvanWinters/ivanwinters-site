    <h2>Project Proposal: Champion Icon Detection and Analysis in League of Legends Mini-Maps</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>1. Main Project Idea or Theme</h3>
    <p>
      The primary objective of this project is to develop a computer vision model that accurately detects and delineates
      the icons of champions on the mini-map in League of Legends (LoL) gameplay videos. By drawing precise borders
      around these icons and determining the confidence levels of each detection, the model aims to provide detailed
      spatial and statistical insights into champion positions and movements throughout a game. This tool can serve as a
      foundational component for advanced analytics in competitive gaming, offering deeper understanding and new metrics
      beyond traditional in-game statistics.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Proposed Approach</h3>
