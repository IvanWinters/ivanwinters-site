      On December 15, 2024 I gave a talk about the relevance of the Halting Problem in modern day computing and other undecidable problems. I also
      discussed the implications of these problems in the context of computability. I used a few examples to illustrate the concepts and how they
      relate to real world applications. The talk was well received and I think it was a good introduction to the topic for those who were not
      familiar with it.

    <p>I am not sure when I will be able to talk about math in the future but this seems like the end of my math career.</p>
